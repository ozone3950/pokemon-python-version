# Pokémon Python Version




### About
I am developing a simple game based off of Pokémon in Python as a self-project to get more familiar with the language and just get better at programming in general for part of my future career. I have been a Pokémon fan for most of my life and thought about creating my own version for a while, so I may as well do it this way if it helps me in the future too.

### Info
The game is a text-based, cut down version of the original Pokémon games, and will have aspects already included in the Pokémon titles, but will have original parts inspired by the same style. The game is set in the Kanto Region, but far enough in the future for the rival to be Professor Oak's grandson.
